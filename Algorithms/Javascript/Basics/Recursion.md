# Recursion
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.


## Three Laws
- Must have a base case
- Must change its state and move toward the base case
- Must call itself, recursively

## Description
- Sometimes known as do-while
- Can be setup to return itself when the base case is hit.
