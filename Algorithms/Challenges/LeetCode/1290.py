# LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer/
# 1290

# Givens
# - head
#   - reference node to singly linked list
# - Value is either 0 or 1
# - Full list holds the binary representation of a number

# Output:
# - Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list

# Constraints
# - List is not empty
# - Number of nodes will not exceed 30
# - Each node's value is either 0 or 1

# PseudoCode
# Function to go through each node & record data values (String or array)
# Function to take vaules (String or array) and calculate binary number

# Observations
# It doesn't look like we even need a linked list because the head is given as an array of the numbers
