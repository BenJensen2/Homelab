# Basics of Algorithms

Definition: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

# Requirements
- Clear and Unambiguous: Each step must be clear in all aspects and must lead to only one meaning
- Well-Defined Inputs:
- Well-Defined Outputs:
- Finite-ness: Should not end up in infinite loops
- Feasible: Simple, generic and practical, such that it can be executed upon will the available resources. It must not contain some future technology, or anything
- Language Independent: Plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will be same, as expected

## Methodology
- Problem: Clear
- Constraints: 
- Input
- Output
- Solution:
  - Pseudo Code
  - Code
- Refactor

## Time & Space
- Time Factor: Counting the number of key operations in the sorting algorithm
- Space Factor: Counting the maximum memory space required by the algorithm
- Space Complexity: Amount of memory that this algorithm requires to execute and get the result.
  - Fixed Part: Space that is definitely required by the algorithm.
  - Variable Part: The space that can be different based on the implementation of the algorithm.
- Time Complexity: The amount of time that this algorithm requires to execute and get the result.
  - Constant Time Part: Any instruction that is executed just once
  - Variable Time Part: Any instruction that is executed more than once
