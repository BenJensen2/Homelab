# Data Structures

### Array
- Static: Fixed size set at declaration
- Dynamic: Size not set at declaration
- 1..n dimensions
- *time complexity:* Big O Cheat Sheet
- *when to use*
  - Retrieving data by index
  - Often iterating through many/all elements (moves pointer)
- *when to avoid*
  - Searching
  - Deleting

### Hash Table
- *time complexity:* Big O Cheat Sheet
- *When to use*
  - Search: Frequent values by key
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
- *When to avoid*
  - Low latency read/write
  - Extremely large data sets
