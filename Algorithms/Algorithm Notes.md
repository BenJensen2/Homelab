## Computers, Software, and SOurce Code

- Computers are machines that perform complex calculations and store immense amounts of data.
- Humans are skille dat creating tools that perform specific tasks very well.
- Components (Semi-conductor chips) advance according to Moore's Law
- Software is a sequence of instructions that we build and provide to a computer, which then “mindlessly” runs those instructions
- Languages: PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Swift, C#, Java, Perl, Erlang, Go, Rust, and others – even HTML and CSS!
  - Interpreted: PHP, Python and Ruby
  - Compiled:

## Code Flow

- When a computer executes (runs) a piece of code, it simply reads each line from the beginning of the file, executing it in order

## Variables

- A variable is a specific spot in memory

## Data Types

- Javascript: Number, String, and Boolean.
- Integers and floating-point numbers – JavaScript makes no such distinction.

## Not all equal signs are the same

- = to **set** things
- == to **test** things
- === to **test** with **types** of things

## Functions

Declaration
```js
function sayMyName() {
  console.log("My name is Martin");
}
```

``` sayMyName(); ``` Actually calls it

## Conditionals
