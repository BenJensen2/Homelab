# Document Object Module (DOM)
The DOM is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web

Every html tag is an object


Window is the global object for javascript code that represents the browser window.
Document is the main entry point to the page.

### Browser Object Model (BOM)
Represents additional objects provided by the browser (host environment) for working with everything except the document.
