# Encryption
Definition: The process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.

## Process
- Sender uses algorithm to scramble a **Plain Text** message which becomes **Ciphertext**
- The receiving party uses a key to unscramble/decrypt the **Ciphertext** into **Plain Text**

## Companies
- RSA Security
  - Dual_EC_DRBG (BSAFE) pseudorandom number generating algorithm (NSA Backdoor) [ARS Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/report-nsa-paid-rsa-to-make-flawed-crypto-algorithm-the-default/)

## Research
- [Cryptography](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/research/cryptography.html): Carnegie Mellon University

## Levels of Encryption
- Highest: AES 256-bit

## Types
- [PGP](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Pretty-Good-Privacy): Pretty Good Privacy
