# Notes


## Intro VI: Big-O
### Time Complexity
### Space Complexity
- Big O just describes the rate of increase
- Drop constants O(2N) to O(N)
- Drop the non-dominant terms O(N + log N) to O(N)
- Add if they happen after another
- Multiply nested
- Amortized time for each adding is O(1)
- Log N runtimes: Number of elements in the problem space gets dalved each time
- Recursive: O(branches^depth)

### Examples & Exercises
- Example 8 (p49): Why log s? Because it's a sorting algorithm?
